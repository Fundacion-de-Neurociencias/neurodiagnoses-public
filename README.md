> **Project Vision & Roadmap: [See our ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md)**

**Neurodiagnoses** is an AI-powered, open-source ecosystem designed to integrate multi-modal data and advanced computational models to enhance the diagnostic precision, risk assessment, and prognostic understanding of complex neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs).

## Ô∏è A Dual-System Architecture: Diagnosis & Prognosis

The Neurodiagnoses ecosystem combines a "glass-box" Bayesian engine for deep diagnosis and "black-box" Machine Learning pipelines for prognosis and risk prediction.

‚öôÔ∏è Getting Started for Developers
This project is architected to run within GitHub Codespaces, which provides a consistent and reproducible development environment.

1. Launch the Environment
Create a new codespace from the main page of the neurodiagnoses repository on GitHub.

2. Initialize Submodules
Our ecosystem uses Git submodules to manage the private neurodiagnoses-engine and the standalone scikg projects. After the Codespace builds, initialize them with this command:

```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

3. Install Dependencies
Install all required Python packages from the master requirements file:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Configure API Keys
The knowledge harvesting and generation pipelines require API keys. Copy the template file and add your key:

```bash
cp neurodiagnoses-engine/api-keys.env.template neurodiagnoses-engine/api-keys.env
# Now, open neurodiagnoses-engine/api-keys.env and add your Gemini API key.
```

5. Launch the Application
The main user interface is a Gradio application. Launch it with:

```bash
python app.py
```

Once running, navigate to the PORTS tab in your Codespace terminal, find the entry for port 7860, and click the globe icon (üåê) to open the application in a new browser tab.
