> **Project Vision & Roadmap: [See our ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md)**

**Neurodiagnoses** is an AI-powered, open-source ecosystem designed to integrate multi-modal data and advanced computational models to enhance the diagnostic precision, risk assessment, and prognostic understanding of complex neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs).

## Ô∏è A Dual-System Architecture: Diagnosis & Prognosis

The Neurodiagnoses ecosystem combines a "glass-box" Bayesian engine for deep diagnosis and "black-box" Machine Learning pipelines for prognosis and risk prediction.

‚öôÔ∏è Getting Started for Developers
This project is architected to run within GitHub Codespaces, which provides a consistent and reproducible development environment.

1. Launch the Environment
Create a new codespace from the main page of the neurodiagnoses repository on GitHub.

2. Environment Setup
The Codespace environment is configured automatically by the `.devcontainer/postCreate.sh` script upon creation. This script handles:
- Git submodule initialization.
- Creation of the `neuro_env` Conda environment from `environment.yml`.
- Global installation of the `gemini-cli`.
- Installation and configuration of `Cipher` to provide a memory layer for AI assistants.
 
After the setup script finishes, open a new terminal. The environment is ready:
- The `gemini` and `cipher` commands are available globally in any terminal.
- For project-specific Python tasks, you must activate the Conda environment:
 
  ```bash
  conda activate neuro_env
  ```
 
  Your terminal prompt will change to show `(neuro_env)`, indicating the environment is active.

3. Configure API Keys
The knowledge harvesting and generation pipelines require API keys. Copy the template file and add your key:

```bash
cp neurodiagnoses-engine/api-keys.env.template neurodiagnoses-engine/api-keys.env
# Now, open neurodiagnoses-engine/api-keys.env and add your Gemini API key.
```

5. Launch the Application
The main user interface is a Gradio application. Launch it with:

```bash
python app.py
```

Once running, navigate to the PORTS tab in your Codespace terminal, find the entry for port 7860, and click the globe icon (üåê) to open the application in a new browser tab.
